      Part 1: Main Store Page

      Requirements:

      1. Header across the top must include your store's name, a logo,
      and use a different background colour, web font, etc.  You must also include
      a link to your contact.html page.  Your header should include info about
      what the store is, what it sells, etc.  Use some images to try and draw
      the user in.  NOTE: place all your site's images in the `src/images/` directory.

      2. Below the header, a multi-column layout of items you can purchase in the
      store.  You must have at least 10 items in your store, and at least 2
      categories of items. For example, if you are selling clothing, you might
      have categories for Men, Women, and Children, and each category would have
      its own set of items.  Each item should include:
      
        - a picture
        - the item's name/title
        - a more complete description of the item
        - a category (i.e., each item must belong to a category)
        - a price.
      
      Each item should be its own " card" (i.e., some kind of box around each item separating one from the next, with
      suitable whitespace between). 3. A sidebar (left or right, depending on your design) of the item layout section,
      showing the different categories of items in your store. If a user clicks on one of the categories, use CSS and
      JavaScript to hide all other items in the store (i.e., only show items for the chosen category). Make sure you
      include a way to return to seeing all categories, and make it obvious to the user that they are only seeing a
      partial list of items when you filter by category (i.e., use CSS and HTML to change things somehow). 4. Below the
      items, a footer with the name of the store, any relevant links you need to give users, as well as a small HTML
      form for entering an Email address and clicking a "Subscribe" button to subscribe to the store's newsletter. Use
      https://formspree.io/ to automatically submit the form to your email address (i.e., when a user fills out their
      email address and clicks submit, *you* should get that information sent to your email address via formspree.io).
      Make sure you setup your account on https://formspree.io/. 5. Use two different Web Fonts for your store. The
      titles should be different from any regular text. Use a free font service like https://fonts.google.com/ or any
      other that you choose. You can also experiment with different font sizes and colours to draw attention toward or
      away from various parts of your design. 6. Pick a colour theme using a tool like https://colorhunt.co/ with at
      least 3 colours (primary, secondary, accent), and use them throughout your site for backgrounds, borders, fonts.
      Your store page needs to look attractive and marks will be given for good a good looking site. No one will buy
      from a store that looks like its owners aren't professional or don't care about details. Also make sure that the
      colour contrast in your site is suitable for everyone to read. 7. Use modern CSS to help you achieve your layout.
      For example, Flexbox and CSS Grid can help you create professional looking layouts. Here are some guides to get
      you started: - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout You are also
      welcome to use existing CSS libraries to help you with your layout, but you must also include your own styles
      (i.e., you can't use a library for everything in your design). 8. Make sure you don't use copyrighted materials
      from other sites. If you use icons, fonts, images, etc., make sure you are legally permitted to reuse them, and
      include references to indicate where you got them. Some resources to consider: - https://unsplash.com/ for images
      - https://fontawesome.com/ for icons - https://gallery.manypixels.co/ or https://undraw.co/illustrations for
      illustrations (SVG) 9. Make sure you reduce the download size of images you include in your store. Users don't
      want to download 10s or 100s of megabytes of data, especially on mobile. You can use an online tool like
      https://squoosh.app/ to help you reduce images. You will lose marks if your images aren't optimized for the web.
      10. Make sure you have no JavaScript or other errors in your Dev Tools Console. Run your site, and test all
      aspects of it with the Console open, and fix any issues you encounter. 11. Make sure your forms all work as they
      should, testing them yourself, and also have someone else test it for you. The easiest way to find bugs in
      software is to let someone who didn't build it try to use it! -->
